# tkinter_meter_feet_converter


## Synopsis

I have used simple tkinter form with text box and button which converts user input values from metre to feet.


## Motivation

The purpose of this app is simply to explore the application of tkinter GUI itself. 

## Installation

Once your python file is ready you need to convert it into executable file. 

For that,

#### if pycharm:

go to View -> Tool Windows -> Terminal

or Simply use (Fn + 12)

Then type pyinstaller file_name.py --onefile and it will convert the file into an executable file format.


#### if Spyder:

go to View -> Panes - > Terminal 

and type the same code  pyinstaller file_name.py --onefile

if you cannot find the terminal, then use the command pip install spyder-terminal in your cmd window to enable the terminal package and then continue as mentioned above.


## Tools Used

I have used Pycharm IDE for this specific app. You can use any IDE but I prefer Pycharm or Spyder when it comes to GUI based app.
